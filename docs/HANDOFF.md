# OKami24 — HANDOFF · v41 · 2026-09-22 (round "backlink" CLOSED: 50 of 53 product pages now carry a way onward to the 12 articles — 112 links total, all 12 articles reached, capped at 3 per page, paired only from an article's own relatedProductSlugs or a rule over VERIFIED product data (batch 1, in `e87dc24`) · the product share card's title now carries the catalog price, e.g. "…ของแท้ ฿2,490", the way brand-page titles already do (batch 2, same commit `e87dc24`, amended) · content-dates.json regenerated (`a70bdb0`) — checker close PASS 21/21: batch 1 6/6 · batch 2 3/3 · close gates 12/12 [ตรวจแล้ว, `_incoming/backlink/checker-close.md`]; not yet merged — Cowork's next step. Base `f766ab3` already carries round "share-deadend" merged via PR #46, tag `share-deadend-done`=`b8e2fd0`.)

Written: 2026-09-22 · Based on: local HEAD `9bcb3df` (full `9bcb3dfff89eaae274f55075c7e2cfb0cb7f8891`, branch `checkpoint/phase-3.3.3`), read directly from `.git/logs/HEAD` [ตรวจแล้ว] · `origin/main` = `b1b319d` (full `b1b319db37ba650d5c2c8279a9daf8df69bd7ba9`, PR #44 merge — updated 2026-09-22 after merge, `git rev-parse origin/main`), read directly from `.git/refs/remotes/origin/main` [ตรวจแล้ว] — this is a stronger check than v34 had (doc-keeper could read the ref file itself this time). What is still **not** independently checked by doc-keeper: the commit message text ("Merge pull request #41…") and the three live-site probes (homepage `<title>`, Organization `alternateName`, `/products/m-bar-15k` description) — those stay [เชื่อว่า], reported by the main agent's `git fetch` + `curl` just before this handoff, no git-log-walk or curl tool available here. This is a full rewrite (skill `handoff`, owner typed `/handoff`, condition (ข)) — the previous file is archived at `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md`, untouched.

> **How to read:** every statement carries one of the three tags of ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 13.10 #9 — **[ตรวจแล้ว]** (seen in the file/commit) / **[เชื่อว่า]** (reported, not verified) / **[รอเจ้าของ]** (needs the owner) · **"ตรวจผ่านตามเกณฑ์" ≠ "เจ้าของอนุมัติ"**
> **รายการงานหลัก = `docs/LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`** — อ่านเฉพาะหัว "สถานะปัจจุบัน" + เลขข้อที่กำลังทำ **ห้ามอ่านทั้งไฟล์**
> **Thai on the site: `docs/THAI_STYLE.md` is the single source of truth** (rules only — §2 four layers · §3 locked words · §4 typing · §5 group ก/ข + typography mechanism · §6 open work). When to read it is decided in skill `round-open` step 1 (13.9 points there): only on rounds that touch site copy. Before→after examples live in `docs/THAI_STYLE_LOG.md` §6–§7 — open only to cite a past ruling.

## Conflicts found

The archived `HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md` was written at the moment the SEO ก round closed, **before** merge/deploy — its §16 said the round was "not yet merged / Cowork's job" and its body sections 1–15 had not been refreshed past the prices-round summary (only the title line and §16 carried SEO-round facts). The repo now shows the round merged (`origin/main` = `6f38745`, PR #41) and the main agent reports it live on the production site. This file rewrites all of §1–§16 on that fact; nothing else in v34 is contradicted by anything doc-keeper could check. [ตรวจแล้ว] for the hash change, [เชื่อว่า] for "PR #41" and "live" specifically (see header).

---

## 1. Current state

**[ตรวจแล้ว]** unless marked otherwise

- **Project:** OKami24 vape shop · Next.js 16 + TS + Tailwind v4 + SQLite · folder `C:\Users\dhetc\Claude-Web-Lab-v3-checkpoint-3.3.3` · GitHub `github.com/dhetchaiyakrith24/okami24-web` (private)
- **Working branch:** `checkpoint/phase-3.3.3` · local HEAD `9bcb3df` [ตรวจแล้ว, `.git/logs/HEAD`] · `origin/main` = `6f38745` [ตรวจแล้ว, `.git/refs/remotes/origin/main`], reported as "Merge pull request #41 from dhetchaiyakrith24/checkpoint/phase-3.3.3" [เชื่อว่า] — branch is ahead of main by **0 commits** if that merge really carries the branch's tip (doc-keeper cannot walk commit ancestry with the tools available; `git log origin/main..HEAD` at the top of the next chat is the way to confirm, see "First things")
- **SEO ก round is closed, tagged, and merged:** tag `seo-a-done` at `68e2a14` [ตรวจแล้ว, `docs/RECOVERY.md` §2 + `.git/refs/tags/seo-a-done` present] · the main agent additionally reports the live site already serves the new head copy (homepage `<title>`, Organization `alternateName` including "OKM", `/products/m-bar-15k` description) [เชื่อว่า]
- **Online ordering is still off** (`OKAMI24_ORDERING=off`, LAUNCH_AUDIT item 43) → LINE `@okm24` is the buy channel · item 44 (7 criteria to reopen ordering) is still **1/7** [ตรวจแล้ว, `docs/LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` item 44 row] — unchanged this round, the SEO round did not touch pricing
- **Checkpoints/tags on record** (all in `docs/RECOVERY.md` §2, the single table): `pre-config-2026-09-09` · `pre-30.1-2026-09-09` · `pre-30.2-2026-09-10` · `lang-done` · `r30-4b-done` · `pre-housekeeping` · `housekeeping-done` · `skills-done` (`9acc296`) · `prices-complete` (`07f74a9`) · `seo-a-done` (`68e2a14`, 2026-09-21) [ตรวจแล้ว, all 10 present under `.git/refs/tags/`]
- **Next round:** not opened. Per `docs/LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` head and this file's §13, the standing order is SEO → articles → data → cart, so articles is next by default; the SEO round's own file also named a possible "SEO ข" (tier-B, internal links/rails) follow-up, which was **named, not opened** [ตรวจแล้ว, `_incoming/seo-a/brief-doc-keeper-handoff.md` line 21]. Which one the owner wants is §7 question (ค).

## 2. Done (working, verified)

**[ตรวจแล้ว]** — full history of each round is in the archived HANDOFF versions cited; this section is the current summary only.

- Everything listed in `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md` §2 (round 30.4ข, skills round, prices round — 53/53 storefront products priced and buyable) is still live and untouched by this round.
- **SEO ก round (2026-09-21, opened and closed in one chat):** Organization + WebSite JSON-LD added to the homepage (`src/lib/seo.ts`) · `offers.seller` on every Product offer · BreadcrumbList (100 pages) / CollectionPage (20) / FAQPage (1) / Article (12) + `offers.shippingDetails` + `hasMerchantReturnPolicy` on 101/105 sitemap pages — the 4 without are `/warranty /shipping /how-to-order /privacy`, the owner's untouchable service-page list, deliberately excluded, not a gap · new `<title>`/description on 9 pages (home · about · contact · /products · /brands/relx · /brands/salthub · /brands/voopoo · /brands/uwell · /products/m-bar-15k), word-for-word from the owner-เคาะ'd table `_incoming/seo-a/table-final-for-owner.md` · a price line on all 53 product descriptions ("ของแท้ ราคา ฿{price} สั่งทาง LINE @okm24", price always read live from the catalog, never typed) · a 22-item short-copy backlog (16 product slugs, 2 guides, 1 technology page, 2 e-liquid category titles, the 404 title) landed in the same commit · checker passed all 3 independent calls, 0 send-backs [ตรวจแล้ว, `_incoming/seo-a/checker-{1,2,3}-findings.txt`]. Full close-verify set is §16 item 6.
- `docs/SEO_BASELINE.md` was written at this round's close from the owner's Search Console read of 2026-09-21 (6–18 Sep window) — 6 numbered predictions of what should move, to be re-read 2026-10-05 [ตรวจแล้ว, file read directly].

## 3. Just done (this session — SEO ก round, 2026-09-21)

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `6873f03` | data(prices): re-verified evidence for caliburn-g4-pro (Pod-168→Pod-181) and muro-3ml, prices unchanged |
| `b07979d` | feat(seo): Organization + WebSite JSON-LD on the homepage, offers.seller on every Product |
| `cd82b45` | docs: HANDOFF v32 — SEO round open, batches 0+1 landed, batch 2 waiting on the owner |
| `5a584eb` | feat(seo): BreadcrumbList / CollectionPage / FAQPage / Article on every indexable page, merchant fields on every Offer |
| `91ef1d9` | docs: HANDOFF v33 — SEO round batch 4 pushed, batch 2 table at thai-copy |
| `0b015bd` | copy(seo): approved title/description set for 9 pages, price line on every product, batch-5 backlog, 404 title |
| `68e2a14` | docs(seo): round A close — HANDOFF v34, ROUND_COST row, RECOVERY tag row, LAUNCH_AUDIT item 19, SEO_BASELINE.md, THAI_STYLE_LOG entries — **tagged `seo-a-done`** |
| `9bcb3df` | docs: RECOVERY.md tag table — seo-a-done (68e2a14, 2026-09-21); HANDOFF v34 hash filled — **current local HEAD** |

All 8 commits above are [ตรวจแล้ว] read directly from `.git/logs/HEAD`. **Count note:** the brief for this handoff said "9" commits for the round but only listed these same 8 hashes; doc-keeper counted 8 in `.git/logs/HEAD` and in `docs/ROUND_COST.md`'s own SEO ก row ("8 incl. the two docs commits at close") [ตรวจแล้ว] — the "9" in the brief looks like a miscount, not a missing commit; flagged, not silently corrected in the source. After `9bcb3df`, the branch was merged into `main` as `6f38745` (PR #41) [เชื่อว่า, main agent's `git fetch` report — see header].

**Moved here from §16 at the search-price round's close (2026-09-22) — §16 hit its 15 KB cap, this is relocation not deletion (doc-keeper spec):** round SEO ข (guides + technology pages, closed 2026-09-22, tag `seo-b-done` = `fdad0b2`) batch-by-batch detail, verbatim from HANDOFF v38 §16 item 3:

> Round summary, batches 1–5 compressed (full batch-by-batch detail is in earlier editions of this file and this file's git history — not restated here to stay under the 15 KB cap): 1 survey+outline (researcher) · 2 YouTube table+oEmbed → STOP 1 "เคาะโครง" 2026-09-21 · 2.5 mechanism committed `5fcc35a` (inline links/H3/FAQ/review-video plumbing) · 3 guides body → STOP 2 "เคาะเนื้อ" 2026-09-21, committed `6851be9`+`e1c6487`+`c31ba63` (7 guides EN/TH/ZH, 39 links, 20 FAQ, 3 clips) · 4 technology pages → STOP 4, committed `e6dcb09` (Article JSON-LD dates/author) + `7d74f46` (5 technology pages EN/TH/ZH) · 5 close: word-break fix `68945f3` (5 locked compounds never split, 11 model names bound, negation joiners) + the round's own docs-close batch.
>
> Owner's stop-1 question, answered (what in the round file made the work harder, one line each): (1) the numeric §ก per-page character targets — withdrawn by the owner; the verified material actually gave 795–1,142 Thai characters per technology page, not the file's target (2) the round file's "do not touch seo.ts / src/app" list conflicted with the Article JSON-LD date/author task the owner gave later in the same chat, on those exact files.

The permanent rulings from that round are NOT moved — they stay live in §16 item 3 (carry-forward, do-not-re-ask list per 13.10 #12).

**Moved here from §16 at the backlink round's close (2026-09-22) — §16 needed the room, this is relocation not deletion (doc-keeper spec):** round share-deadend (closed 2026-09-22, tag `share-deadend-done` = `b8e2fd0`, merged into main via PR #46) full batch detail, verbatim from HANDOFF v40 §16 item 3:

> **share-deadend**: base `d5a336d` (tag `search-price-done`), `_incoming/share-deadend/round.md`. **b1 share cards**: the root layout's `openGraph.title`/`description` were inherited by 52 of 105 live pages — every article, brand page, category page, the FAQ, the service pages and the homepage shared one card [ตรวจแล้ว, `og-gate-before-live.log`: og:title≠<title> 52, one duplicate title spanning those 52 pages, FAIL 104]. Both root fields removed, no new copy — Next now fills each page's card from its own title/description; `openGraphWithImage` also gained siteName/type on the 53 product pages that had been shipping without them · `464e842` · new gates: `scripts/og-gate.js` (whole sitemap, added to skill `round-close` step 3) + `src/lib/og-metadata-contract-test.ts` (9 checks, in verify:catalog) · local after: **103/103 PASS** [ตรวจแล้ว, `close-og-gate.log`]. **b2 empty-category dead ends**: `/products/e-liquid` + `/products/heated-tobacco-consumables` were reachable from the home SHOP grid, both header menus and the footer, but held no products · new `src/lib/category-visibility.ts` (mirrors `brand-visibility.ts`) drops an empty category from all 4 nav surfaces + the sitemap and marks its page noindex, while the URL keeps working and returns by itself once stock lands · page shows "ยังไม่มีสินค้าในหมวดนี้" + "กลับมาดูใหม่เมื่อมีสินค้าเพิ่ม" (owner's approved sentence, split at its dash) + "หมวดอื่นที่มีของ" linking the 6 populated categories; filter sidebar, phone filter button, in-category search and sort hidden there · `d6b9fd3` · `9313125` (round-close skill gained the two new gate lines) · `1ee63be` (content-dates.json regenerated after b2). **Sitemap is now 103 URLs, not 105** [ตรวจแล้ว, count 103 in `close-jsonld.log`+`close-og-gate.log`+`close-scan.log`+`close-overflow-390.log`]. **Checker close: PASS 9/9 brief items + 12/12 close gates, 0 fail** [ตรวจแล้ว, `_incoming/share-deadend/checker-close.md`, on `1ee63be`]. Owner ruling this round (do not re-ask, 13.10 #12): "เคาะทางตัน" 2026-09-22 chat, 5 numbered points — the copy, the 4-nav-surface list and the noindex/returns-by-itself mechanism above are that ruling as built. Merge+deploy = Cowork, not done at v40's time of writing (since merged, via PR #46).

round search-price (closed 2026-09-22, tag `search-price-done` = `5e9fd24`) full batch detail, verbatim from HANDOFF v40 §16 item 3:

> **search-price** (closed, tag `search-price-done`=`5e9fd24`): Thai search wired into /search + every grid page's own search box (`src/lib/catalog-search.ts`+`src/data/search-aliases.ts`, `efcf878`) · desktop card price variant B, price its own line under the tagline (`7436150`) · sitemap lastmod + Article dateModified read from git, not the build clock (`51bc83b`+`850ecec`) · owner's full 17-brand/family alias set + a gate that every brand on sale has one, at close (`ab3e353`) · checker close 6/6 pass, 2 observations: "พอตใช้แล้วทิ้ง" has no alias key by design (it is the category label, finds itself) · "เอ็มบาร์" returns all 9 SALTHUB products not just the 4-product family, because "M Bar" also appears in Zero products' spec text (gate checks missing=0 only). Owner rulings that round (13.10 #12, unchanged): variant B card · "น้ำยา" keeps returning its 3 prefilled items (m-switch-pod, muro-3ml, coil-74) · aliases: many spellings per brand ok, one direction, never rendered, Code may add/drop without asking · "บุหรี่ไฟฟ้า" ok as a typed search word only (site-copy ban unchanged) · every brand on sale needs a Thai alias.

Permanent rulings from both rounds are NOT moved — the share-deadend copy/mechanism ruling and the search-price alias/variant-B rulings stay live in §16 item 3 (carry-forward, do-not-re-ask list per 13.10 #12).

## 4. Known broken / missing, not fixed yet

- **[ตรวจแล้ว] og:title of the homepage is still the pre-round string** ("OKami24 — ของแท้ ราคาตรง บริการจริง") — the owner's approved table covered `<title>`/description/og:description only; og:title was never in scope this round. Confirmed absent from `_incoming/seo-a/table-final-for-owner.md` and from THAI_STYLE_LOG's own round entry, which notes it explicitly [ตรวจแล้ว, `docs/THAI_STYLE_LOG.md` line 905].
- **[ตรวจแล้ว] THAI_STYLE.md §3 has no rows for the round's 4 new head-copy words** ("ร้านพอต", "บอกราคาทุกตัว", "Marbo", "ไม่มีคอยล์มาในกล่อง/ต้องซื้อคอยล์แยก") — confirmed by grep, they exist only in `THAI_STYLE_LOG.md` §7's round table, not as locked-word rows in `THAI_STYLE.md` §3. This is a deliberate omission per the brief (head copy only, judge after 14 days), not an oversight — see §7 question (ก).
- **[ตรวจแล้ว] Resolver test coverage gap (carried from the prices round, untouched this round):** no test calls `resolveProductRef()` with a real, catalogued, unpriced legacy slug, because all 45 legacy products are now priced. Accepted by Cowork until the cart round.
- **[เชื่อว่า] freeShippingThreshold (500 THB) not expressed in structured data** — deliberate: schema.org places that field on `ShippingRateSettings`, not `OfferShippingDetails`, and Google's merchant parser does not read it there. Per the round's own commit-message reasoning, not independently re-derived by doc-keeper against schema.org's spec text.
- **[รอเจ้าของ/Cowork] Rich Results Test, GSC "validate fix", and index requests for the 45 currently un-indexed URLs are Cowork's post-deploy steps** — named in `docs/SEO_BASELINE.md`, not yet confirmed done by anyone in this chat.
- 4 service pages carry no JSON-LD by owner ruling — not a bug, listed here only so it is not mistaken for one.
- **12 product descriptions are trimmed versions** of their base spec sentence, cut to fit the 160-character description limit after the price line was appended — actual close-time count is **28**, not 12 (the checker's mid-round count of 12 was taken before batch 5's extra overrides were added; both numbers are real, from different points in the round) [ตรวจแล้ว, `_incoming/seo-a/close-desc-price-gate.log`]. List of all 28 is in that file.
- Everything `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md` §4 listed and did not resolve is still open: caliburn-g4-pro Shipnity code (resolved: Pod-181, per commit `6873f03` — no longer open, listed here only to close the loop) · muro-3ml Shipnity-table absence (resolved: kept ฿99) · footer.tagline 3-word repeat · zh compatibility-note strings (2 spots) · Coil-72/89 category-label mismatch · 6 cards with an empty spec row · `ProductHero.tsx` stats not checking `verified` · TPD labelling on VINCI S/G3 mini · `PuffCount.tsx` dead code · `/favorites` and order-status zh eyebrow⊂H1 duplication · a Tier-B backlog of ~30 word-break items the owner declined to chase one by one · #31/#34 iPhone check · 2 `priority` spots · `th.ts` dead strings · hidden FAQ research · a stray dev-language comment in `relx.ts:19`.

---

## 5. In progress (scaffolded, needs continuation)

None. [ตรวจแล้ว] The SEO ก round closed cleanly, merged (per the main agent's report), and this handoff is the closing action. No branch work is mid-flight. The next round (articles, or SEO ข if the owner opens it instead — §7(ค)) has not been opened.

---

## 6. Needed, not started

Same long list as `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md` §6 (next rounds per LAUNCH_AUDIT: articles · data round — Coil-72/89 taxonomy, TPD, ProductHero verified-gate, PuffCount removal · cart round + item 49 + order-status eyebrow · item 45 security review · admin page (item 1, parked) · QR library (items 40/41) · item 42 path-2 offsite backup (R2/B2) · sales/label/meta rounds) — plus:

- **SEO ข (tier B — internal links/rails)**, named as a possible follow-up inside the SEO ก round file but never opened; needs the owner to choose it or articles first (§7(ค)).
- When the stock API lands, overwrite the 20 `basis: "owner-estimate"` rows in `src/data/shipnity-seed/legacy-price-approvals.ts` with real supplier prices, in that one file only [ตรวจแล้ว, `docs/BUSINESS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` §5].

---

## 7. Questions for the owner

| Topic | Known | Unknown | What to answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add the round's 4 new words to THAI_STYLE §3 as locked words | Currently only logged in THAI_STYLE_LOG §7, used in head copy only | Whether they should become site-wide locked vocabulary now or after they prove out | Recommended: not yet — head copy only, judge after 14 days (2026-10-05, alongside the GSC re-read) |
| og:title of the homepage still reads the pre-round string | Approved table never covered og:title | Whether the owner wants it to match the new `<title>` (A1: "OKami24 (OKM) — พอตของแท้ ราคาตรง บริการจริง") | Recommended: yes, fold into the next copy round — not urgent enough for its own round |
| Which round opens next: articles (LAUNCH_AUDIT's stated order) or SEO ข (tier B, named but not opened) | Both are legitimate "next" candidates; LAUNCH_AUDIT's written order says articles, the SEO round file suggested SEO ข as a possible follow-up | Owner's priority | No recommendation — this is a priority call, not a technical one |
| Everything else | Unchanged since `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md` §7 / §16 item 4 — see that list (9.4 rollback drill · footer.tagline · zh notes · TPD · #31/#34 iPhone · Render OOM watch · priority spots · Lighthouse · items 10/13/16/37 · account name · black-pod photos · R2/B2 · QR library · account 189) | — | Not repeated here to keep this table short |

---

## 8. Risks and things to watch (most dangerous first)

1. **[ตรวจแล้ว] 20 legacy prices are owner estimates — now also shown in Google snippets** via the price line and brand-page titles. When the stock API overwrites `legacy-price-approvals.ts`, the head copy follows automatically (price is never typed, always read live) — but Google's own cached snippet will lag behind the real change until it recrawls.
2. **[รอเจ้าของ] GSC numbers must be re-read 2026-10-05** against `docs/SEO_BASELINE.md` before anyone judges whether this round worked — reading them earlier will show noise, not signal.
3. **[เชื่อว่า] Production DB backup cadence unverified today** — `render.yaml` declares a 6-hourly backup; nobody has checked the Render log for a `[backup]` line since the SEO round closed. Low current risk (cart is off).
4. **Cowork merges and deploys without announcing it in chat** — `git fetch` before trusting any "main is at X" claim; this file's own `origin/main` value is [ตรวจแล้ว] against the local ref file only, not against GitHub itself.
5. Resolver test coverage gap (§4) — carried risk, unchanged this round.
6. **Session/tool findings worth carrying forward** (session-specific, not project bugs): none new this session worth recording — no tool failures reported for the SEO round's chat.
7. The two-tier rule (tier A/B), NBSP/word-joiner mechanism, and the full do-not-touch list are unchanged and live in §17 below — read there, not restated here.

---

## 9. Do not tear down (owner-approved or working as intended)

Everything in `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md` §9 / §17 "Do not touch" (the single list — layout, images, motion, ordering-mode.ts, slugs/URLs, service pages, Hero.tsx, THAI_STYLE group ก words, card-headline-spec.ts, TrustBar, sticky /compare header, every locked THAI_STYLE_LOG §7 row, the `basis` field and 20 owner-estimate price rows, the three project skills, HANDOFF §16 item 6 as the single home of verify counts, etc. — not restated here) **plus, added this round:**

- The 4 service pages' "no JSON-LD" state — owner ruling, deliberate, not a gap to close later.
- The trim rule in the SEO round's head-copy code (owner: cut at a sentence/phrase boundary, never mid-word, never a dangling connective, never a bare floating number, never a stranded clause-opener) — described in full in `docs/THAI_STYLE_LOG.md` §7 row 6 of the round's table.
- Prices are never typed into head copy — always read live from `priceOf`/`getCatalogItem`.
- "น้ำยา" stays out of head copy until the e-liquid category has real stock on the storefront (re-confirmed this round, not a new rule — original ruling 2026-09-13).

---

## 10. Git — how mixed working-tree changes should be split into commits

**[ตรวจแล้ว]** Working tree is clean as of local HEAD `9bcb3df` except this docs edit (this file itself) and the gitignored `_incoming/seo-a/` briefs folder. The archive copy `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md` (untracked per the git-status snapshot at session start) belongs in the same docs commit that lands this file. Nothing else is uncommitted, so there is nothing to split this round. Branch `checkpoint/phase-3.3.3` is reported fully contained in `origin/main` [เชื่อว่า] — never merge yourself; that is Cowork's job.

---

## 11. Readiness per system

| System | Status | One-line reason |
|---|---|---|
| Catalog browse / search / compare | Ready, live | Unchanged this round |
| Pricing (53 storefront products) | Ready, live | 53/53 buyable, 0 unpriced — unchanged this round |
| SEO structured data | Live | 101/105 pages carry JSON-LD; 53/53 Product offers have price/seller/shippingDetails/hasMerchantReturnPolicy [ตรวจแล้ว, `close-jsonld-all.log`] |
| SEO head copy (title/description) | Live | 9 pages re-titled, 53/53 product descriptions carry a price line [ตรวจแล้ว, `close-desc-price-gate.log`] |
| GSC validation (Rich Results, indexing requests) | Pending | Cowork's post-deploy step, not yet confirmed done [รอเจ้าของ/Cowork] |
| Online ordering (cart/checkout) | Off on purpose | `OKAMI24_ORDERING=off`; item 44 at 1/7 criteria |
| LINE ordering path | Ready, live | `/cart` and `/checkout` redirect to `?order=line`; unchanged |
| Admin page | Parked, not started | Owner order — do not build without being asked |
| Production DB backup | Configured, unverified today | `render.yaml` declares 6-hourly; no fresh Render-log check this round [รอเจ้าของ] |

## 12. What was mid-flight when the chat closed

Nothing. [ตรวจแล้ว] The SEO ก round closed, tagged, and (per the main agent's report) merged and deployed before this handoff was written. What is genuinely open is not "mid-flight work" but **decisions waiting on the owner** — three new questions in §7, plus the carried-forward older list.

---

## 13. Recommended next steps (ordered, with reasons)

1. Paste the §16 block into a new chat, then run `git fetch` + `git status` + `git log -5 --oneline` + `git tag -n1` and compare with what §16 says — if they differ, trust the repo (also "First things" item 1 below).
2. **Do not open the next round without the owner.** Route the three questions in §7 to the owner as one batch (13.4 #6) — which round is next (articles vs SEO ข) is itself one of those questions.
3. When the owner opens the next round, run `scope-auditor` once and build the round's instruction file from `docs/TEMPLATES.md` (ก).
4. On or after 2026-10-05, read `docs/SEO_BASELINE.md` and ask Cowork for the new GSC numbers before judging whether the SEO ก round worked.
5. 9.4 (rollback drill) stays with the owner + Cowork, off-hours, per `docs/RECOVERY.md` §1.

---

## 14. Stop doing (things that waste time or add risk)

- **Typing prices or counts into copy** — every number in head copy now comes live from the catalog; typing one defeats the point of this round.
- **Re-asking the rulings in §16 item 4b** — settled, do not re-litigate.
- **Running screenshot passes on tier-A (head-copy/data-only) rounds** — the SEO ก round needed zero screenshots.
- **Reading `docs/LAUNCH_AUDIT.md` in full** — read the head + the one item number in play, per its own house rule.
- **Judging the SEO round's success before 2026-10-05** — GSC data before then is noise, not signal.

---

## 15. Project end state — full flow, marking which steps already work

**Search → product page with price and structured data → LINE `@okm24`** — works today, live, and is now more discoverable (SEO ก round). [ตรวจแล้ว, LAUNCH_AUDIT §1 head + this round's close-verify set]
**Cart / checkout** — scaffolded but switched off; waits on the stock API landing and on LAUNCH_AUDIT item 44's remaining 6 criteria. Full step-by-step flow (browse → colour/flavour pick → stock check → payment → confirmation → order status) is unchanged from `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-15-v21.md` §15 — read there for the complete diagram; nothing about the cart itself moved this round.

---

## 16. Paste block for the next chat (copy-paste) — keeps only 6 things: main · what the branch is ahead by · open round and where it stopped · waiting on the owner · open questions · verify baseline at the last close (cap 15 KB · rules/tools = §17)

Read first: the single list is step 1 of skill round-open (.claude/skills/round-open/SKILL.md — 13.9 points there; opening a round = that skill, closing = round-close, touching site copy = thai-check)

1 main: origin/main = `f766ab3` (full `f766ab3f04de19129ac54d2cd448b579356e9ac0`) [ตรวจแล้ว, `.git/refs/remotes/origin/main`] — unchanged this batch; round "backlink" not yet merged (round "share-deadend" already is — that merge via PR #46 is what produced this `f766ab3`). Tags on record [ตรวจแล้ว, `.git/refs/tags/` + `.git/packed-refs`]: pre-config-2026-09-09 · pre-30.1-2026-09-09 · pre-30.2-2026-09-10 · lang-done · r30-4b-done · pre-housekeeping · housekeeping-done · skills-done (9acc296) · prices-complete (07f74a9) · seo-a-done (68e2a14) · seo-b-done (fdad0b2) · search-price-done (5e9fd24) · share-deadend-done (b8e2fd0). `backlink-done` **NOT yet present** [ตรวจแล้ว, no file at `.git/refs/tags/backlink-done`] — main agent tags it on the docs-close commit after local HEAD `a70bdb0`; RECOVERY.md §2 already carries its row with hash `[รอ hash — เติมในคอมมิตถัดไป]`. git fetch before trusting any merge claim · never merge yourself.
2 branch ahead of main by **3 commits** (2 walked directly in `.git/logs/HEAD` [ตรวจแล้ว] + this docs commit, hash pending): `e87dc24` (full `e87dc2443b9fc6b51367a35e18c472305c680259`) round backlink, both batches — this is an amend of an earlier commit `eee799c` (batch 1 alone) done before any push, so the message describes the commit's real final contents, not just batch 1 · `a70bdb0` (full `a70bdb0694b22c914a0eaa2bbfaa56980c3a9782`) content-dates.json regenerated after `e87dc24`. Confirm with `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`.
3 round: **"backlink" — CLOSED 2026-09-22** on base `f766ab3` (tag `share-deadend-done` = `b8e2fd0`, PR #46), `_incoming/backlink/`. **Batch 1 (tier B)**: 0 → **50 of 53 product pages carry 112 links** to the 12 articles, **12/12 articles reached** [ตรวจแล้ว, summed directly from `_incoming/backlink/product-page-link-count-results.txt`: 53 rows, 3 at 0 (iqosheet-16, iqosheet-18 — no article is about heated-tobacco sticks; pod-159 — no verified spec row), sum of the other 50 = 112; independently matches the checker's own count]. Pairing decided by `src/lib/article-relevance.ts` from two sources only: an article's own `relatedProductSlugs` read backwards, or a rule over the product's VERIFIED data with evidence recorded per link; `attributes.drawStyle` deliberately unused (unverified Finder attribute, standing ruling) · cap 3 per page [ตรวจแล้ว, max value in the link-count file is 3]. New component `src/components/product/RelatedArticles.tsx`; one new dictionary key `product.readMoreEyebrow` = "อ่านต่อ" / "Read more" / "了解更多" [ตรวจแล้ว, `th.ts:207` / `en.ts:199` / `zh.ts:192`] — owner 2026-09-22, after rejecting the main agent's proposal to reuse `footer.learn` ("เรียนรู้"); no other new copy, no price or cart in the block [เชื่อว่า, reported]. **Batch 2 (tier A)**: the product share card's title now carries the catalog price the way brand-page titles already do — e.g. "VOOPOO DRAG 6 พอตคิท ของแท้ ฿2,490" (`shareTitleWithPriceTh`) [ตรวจแล้ว, function in `src/i18n/search-head-copy.ts`, used in `src/app/products/[slug]/page.tsx`]; the price was already in og:description but past the 160-character point where a preview cuts it; `<title>` itself is untouched (its 53 strings stay in the GSC measurement window opened at the share-deadend close, until 2026-10-05) · `scripts/og-gate.js` gained one narrow exception: a "฿<number>" tail is allowed only when that same number also appears in that page's own og:description [ตรวจแล้ว, `og-gate.js` lines 76–86]. **Also**: `scripts/shot.js` gained `--anchor "<selector>"` — the new block sits ~5000px down a product page, past the tool's old 4000px cap and always-reset-to-top default [ตรวจแล้ว, `shot.js` lines 32–77]. **Checker: PASS 21/21** (batch 1 6/6 · batch 2 3/3 · close gates 12/12) [ตรวจแล้ว, `_incoming/backlink/checker-close.md`]. Owner ruling this round (do not re-ask, 13.10 #12): `readMoreEyebrow` = "อ่านต่อ", not `footer.learn`, 2026-09-22 chat. Merge+deploy = Cowork, not done. Tag `backlink-done` pending, see item 1.
  Previous round share-deadend (closed, tag `share-deadend-done`=`b8e2fd0`, merged into main via PR #46): full batch detail **moved to §3** this close (15 KB cap, relocated not deleted — doc-keeper spec).
  Previous round search-price (closed, tag `search-price-done`=`5e9fd24`): full batch detail **moved to §3** this close (15 KB cap, relocated not deleted — doc-keeper spec).
  Previous round SEO ข (closed, tag `seo-b-done`=`fdad0b2`): 7 guides + 5 technology pages grown (verified examples, links, FAQ, clips), word-break fix `68945f3` at close — full batch detail **moved to §3** that batch (15 KB cap, relocated not deleted — doc-keeper spec). Permanent rulings carry forward (13.10 #12, unchanged): gate 11 — every "ร้านเรา/ที่ร้าน" sentence traces to BSOT or is cut · no completeness claims about stock · no per-model draw-style claims · conflicting numbers are cut, not fixed · an absence claim must trace to a real record field · the NEVER_SPLIT typography list ≠ a THAI_STYLE §3 word-choice rule · the 390px overflow scan is a standing close gate.
  Previous round SEO ก (closed, tag `seo-a-done`=`68e2a14`) — see `docs/archive/HANDOFF.2026-09-21-v34.md`.
4 waiting on the owner: **none from this round** — backlink closed, both batches + close checked and passed [ตรวจแล้ว, `checker-close.md`]. Cowork: merge backlink into main, then deploy (share-deadend is already merged, per item 1). Unchanged: (ก) add SEO ก's 4 head-copy words to THAI_STYLE §3? recommended not yet, judge after 2026-10-05 — this is the same window the batch-2 price-title strings now also sit in.

5 open questions: **new (backlink close)** — (a) the "อ่านต่อ" block sits ~5000px down a product page — Google sees it, few visitors scroll that far; if a round ever rebuilds the product-page layout, consider moving it up (owner noted it 2026-09-22, explicitly not this round) (b) pre-existing, outside this round, found by the checker: a raw Thai string "สอบถามสินค้า" shows on the EN locale from `src/components/layout/LineContact.tsx` [เชื่อว่า, `checker-close.md`]. Carried from share-deadend close, unchanged: (c) the two categories return to the sitemap and all 4 nav surfaces by themselves once stock lands — no manual step [ตรวจแล้ว, mechanism in `src/lib/category-visibility.ts`, per checker] (d) 4 noindex tool pages in the sitemap (how-to-order/shipping/warranty/privacy — no ld+json, per `close-jsonld.log`) — SEO-review proposal, not done. Carried from search-price close, unchanged: (e) TFIT/INFY aliases deferred until those products are unhidden [ตรวจแล้ว, comment in `search-aliases.ts`] (f) content-date granularity is per source file (7 guides share one dateModified) — revisit only if articles get one file each. Unchanged older: "แถว/บรรทัด" not locked · caliburn-g5↔coil-94 mL disagreement · Finder draw-style unverified · 27 products without a clip · writer's optional VINCI S sentence unused · memory files unaudited by rule-auditor (housekeeping candidate) · LAUNCH_AUDIT split proposed, not done · production backup cadence unconfirmed [เชื่อว่า] per render.yaml · when the stock API lands, overwrite the 20 owner-estimate rows in `legacy-price-approvals.ts`.

## First things the next chat should do

1. **`git fetch` + `git status` + `git log -5 --oneline` + `git tag -n1`**, then compare with §16 above — if they differ, trust the repo. In particular, confirm `origin/main` really contains local HEAD `9bcb3df` as an ancestor (via `git log origin/main..HEAD` printing nothing): this file's writer (doc-keeper) could read the raw ref hash but had no tool to walk commit ancestry or decode the merge commit's message.
2. If `origin/main` matches §16 item 1, there is nothing left to probe from this round except Cowork's post-deploy GSC steps (§4, §13) — the only open work otherwise is the three owner decisions in §7/§16 item 4.
3. **No round is open.** Do not start the next one on your own — wait for the owner to pick articles vs "SEO ข" (§7(ค)) and attach an instruction file → skill `round-open`. When it opens, run `scope-auditor` once and read `docs/THAI_STYLE.md` only if the round touches site copy.
