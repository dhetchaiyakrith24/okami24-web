/**
 * OKami24 — round 30.3ข (owner, 2026-09-11): the Thai <title> templates for the generated pages.
 *
 * Why Thai, and why one string: the site renders Thai for every first visit (DEFAULT_LOCALE), and
 * a crawler sends no language cookie, so the server-side <title>/meta IS what Google shows. The
 * owner ruled the title stays a single server string (no per-language tab title — considered and
 * rejected, see docs/THAI_STYLE.md §6) — so these templates produce Thai, and the model/brand name
 * inside stays English (THAI_STYLE §2 layer 1).
 *
 * The layout appends " — OKami24" to every title (src/app/layout.tsx `title.template`); the
 * ceilings the owner set (~55–60 characters for a title) are measured INCLUDING that suffix —
 * the longest product title this produces is 54 (checked over all 53 storefront products).
